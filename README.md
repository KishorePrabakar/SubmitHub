# üì∏ SubmitHub

SubmitHub is a full-stack web application designed to streamline how colleges and clubs manage competition submissions. Initially built to replace scattered WhatsApp photo submissions, it is evolving into a scalable platform for handling diverse event entries.

* Robust full-stack architecture with Next.js 14 (App Router) and FastAPI/tRPC
* Type-safe development with React 18 + TypeScript
* Modern UI/UX powered by Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
* Streamlined forms with React Hook Form + Zod validation
* PostgreSQL 16 database with Prisma ORM for scalability

## üåç Vision

Beyond photography, it can support hackathons, design challenges, writing contests, and other events‚Äîequipping institutions with a professional and efficient competition workflow.
